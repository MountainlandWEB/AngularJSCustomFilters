## Mini Project: Case Conversion Filters

AngularJS already comes with two built-in case filters: uppercase and lowercase.

You will need to implement a custom filter that takes a parameter to specify any of the following conversions:

* PascalCase
* camelCase
* dot.case
* hyphen-case
* snake_case
* SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
* words case

Your filter should convert "hello world" and convert it into "HelloWorld" when passed in 'pascal' as the conversion parameter. Likewise, passing in 'words' and applying the filter to "HelloWorld", it should convert it back to "hello world".
